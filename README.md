## Understanding xG by Match Segments (Expected Goals by Time Intervals)
### Premier League Game between Southampton y Bournemouth


In this analysis, I work with xG (Expected Goals) rather than actual goals.
xG represents the quality of chances a team creates, based on factors such as shot location, angle, pressure, and type of play. It tells us how many goals a team should have scored according to the probability of each shot.

When we calculate xG by match segments, we divide the match into time intervals (for example 0–15, 15–30, 30–45, 45–60, 60–75, 75–90 minutes) and compute the xG generated in each segment.

This allows us to understand:

1. Which team dominated different phases of the match
2. When a team created more dangerous chances
3. Whether a team “deserved” more based on chance quality, even if they did not score

In short, xG by segments does not measure actual goals.
It measures performance and “deservedness” throughout the match, using the quality of chances created.
